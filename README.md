A repository is a design pattern that provides an abstraction layer between the application and the data source. It encapsulates the logic required to access and manipulate data, and provides a consistent interface for the application to work with regardless of the specific data source being used.

In the context of Laravel, repositories are often used to abstract away the details of working with different types of data sources such as databases, APIs, and third-party services. By defining a common interface for accessing data, repositories make it easy to switch out different data sources without having to modify the application code.

ensure an ```App\Contracts``` directory in the app folder exists or create it, and add DoServiceInterface.php to it

```bash
mkdir app/Contracts
touch app/Contracts/DoServiceInterface.php
```

Add the namespace and the do() method, set to return a string as follows

```php
<?php

namespace App\Contracts;

interface DoServiceInterface {

    /**
     * Minimal example of a method that returns a string
     * @return string
     */
    public function do(): string;
}
```

ensure or create an ```App\Services``` directory in the app folder exists and add ```DoServiceA.php``` and ```DoServiceB.php```

```bash
mkdir app/Services
touch app/Services/DoServiceA.php
touch app/Services/DoServiceB.php
```

Create each file as follows

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Contracts\DoServiceInterface;

class DoServiceA implements DoServiceInterface {

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     * @return string the string 'DoServiceA' as the name of this service
     */
    public function do(): string {
        return 'DoServiceA';
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Contracts\DoServiceInterface;

class DoServiceB implements DoServiceInterface {

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     * @return string the string 'DoServiceB' as the name of this service
     */
    public function do(): string {
        return 'DoServiceA';
    }
}
```

Note that in these examples, we assume that ```DoService``` is an interface that you have defined elsewhere in your codebase. You would need to include the appropriate ```use``` statement for this interface in each implementation file.
